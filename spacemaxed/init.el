The reason we don't affect evil's \"insert\" state is to
*avoid* encouraging lots of motion-jumping around within a
single insert state. For example, if you bound a key to let
you jump to another part of the file while still in
insert-state, you could stay in insert state forever, and
then when you finally *DO* leave the state and press \"u\"
to undo something, you will lose ALL of your work as one big
chunk. Constantly leaving insert-state via ESC to break up
your work into chunks is a CORE aspect of how editing is
*supposed* to work in Vim and Evil mode! It *ensures* that
your undo/redo-states have logical chunks.

If you really want to perform a Evil Normal-state action
while staying in Insert mode, then press Ctrl-o to enter
\"perform next command as if in Normal mode\" state. With
that, you can press your desired motion key even from within
Insert-mode, in situations where you need it!

Here are the maps this sets the key in, and their purposes:

`evil-normal-state-map':
  The normal state when you aren't in any specialized evil
  mode. This is the state you return to via ESC. It has all
  your normal initial keys, such as \"d\"elete and \"y\"ank.

`evil-motion-state-map':
  Used for operator motions, and affects the meaning of the
  second \"movement\" key AFTER you've pressed a normal key
  like \"d\"elete or \"y\"ank. An example of a motion would
  be \"j\" for \"go down one line\".
  Note that certain motions like \"s\" have special handling
  and cannot be rebound by setting them in this state map!
  An example of that is \"s\"urround, which is hardcoded to
  use the special `evil-surround-mode-map' instead, and that
  map in turn contains non-standard submaps, and the only
  way to rebind those submaps is via `evil-define-key'!

`evil-visual-state-map':
  Used for motions in all visual modes; character, line, block.

We don't affect `global-map' at all, meaning the default
fallback map which is used if a key isn't overridden in any
of the loaded major or minor mode maps. Therefore, anything
you bind via this function will *only* work within Evil
mode. It won't work at all within regular Emacs mode!
That is *intentional*, because anything you bind in the
`global-map' will be active in Evil's Insert mode too! So if
you bound something to \"Shift-Q\" for instance, then you'd
be unable to type a \"Q\" character while in Evil's Insert
mode! Furthermore, it would yet again re-introduce the
problem we're trying to avoid, which is to *not* bind in
Insert mode, so that we *discourage* creating huge chunks of
work within a single undo-history entry!

One side-effect of not affecting the `global-map' is that
you won't see if your Evil mode re-bindings are actually
overriding a global fallback that was used by Evil's lack of
own bindings for that key. So it's a very good idea to first
try your key by pressing \"SPC h d k\" and then the key, to
see if anything is bound to it by default in Emacs. If so,
you'll probably want to manually create another `global-map'
entry which rebinds whatever global behavior you're
overriding due to your Evil maps.

To manually add a `global-map' fallback default, use this:
  bind-key key def global-map

Lastly, if you're REALLY sure you want to override a certain
key in EVERY keymap inside of Emacs, for ALL Evil states and
ALL other modes globally, then use the `bind-key*' function
instead. It will install an ENFORCED global override which
replaces ALL other meanings for that key EVERYWHERE!
But you should be VERY sure that such bindings don't destroy
keybind functionality of the modes you use! For example,
lots of modes use the Tab key for something useful, and it's
a terrible idea to rebind Tab globally!

To manually ENFORCE a certain key behavior globally, use this:
  bind-key* key def"
    (while key ; imagine that the key is "Alt-q"
      ;; NOTE: We don't touch evil-operator-state-map, because that's just
      ;; a special map containing "i" (inside) and "a" (around) sub-maps
      ;; that are loaded when pressing "i" or "a" in evil-motion-state-map.
      (bind-key key def evil-normal-state-map) ; ie: Alt-q
      (bind-key key def evil-motion-state-map) ; ie: d Alt-q
      (bind-key key def evil-visual-state-map) ; ie: v Alt-q
      (setq key (pop bindings) def (pop bindings))))

  ;; once per each line that was affected by block insertion. But you won't miss
  ;; having line numbers after you've tried these commands instead! And you can
  ;; always read the current line number in the statusline.
  ;;
  ;; We'll add a few new Evil mode motions, which allow you to extremely rapidly
  ;; jump to exact lines or character pairs on screen. The shortcut keys were
  ;; carefully chosen to be sure they don't conflict with anything in any Evil
  ;; mode or any other buffer modes used in combination with Evil, or any major
  ;; default shortcuts (such as Ctrl-q for literal character insertion).
  ;; The "q" is a mnemonic for "quick goto".

  ;; -<Shift-Q> = Type two characters to list jump candidates on screen. Very
  ;;  easy to type and is also super close to w and e, which you may want to use
  ;;  after jumping.
  ;; -<Alt-q> = Easily jump to any line on screen. Less important now that you
  ;;  can jump to direct character positions in lines via the previous shortcut,
  ;;  which is why this one is placed on the harder-to-type Alt-key. But it's
  ;;  still pretty easy, especially if you just the right-alt key to avoid
  ;;  having to do finger gymnastics with your left hand.
  ;;
  ;; These keys are NOT bound in Evil's insert mode. Because making it too easy
  ;; to jump around lines could cause you to stay forever in insert mode, and
  ;; then when you finally press Esc and "u" to undo something, you would undo
  ;; all of the work as one giant chunk. You are *meant* to periodically leave
  ;; insert mode via Esc, to split your undo history into logical chunks!
  ;;
  ;; However, if you *really* want to perform a jump while in insert mode, just
