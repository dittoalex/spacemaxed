* Requirements Before You Begin

** Source Code Pro Font

   Download the font release file and install all of the OTF (/not/ TTF)
   fonts from https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.

** Homebrew

   Install homebrew from http://brew.sh.

** Node + NPM

   Use homebrew to install the latest Node and NPM (which is yet another package
   manager). Lots of important utilities for programming are written in Node
   and will be installed via NPM.

   We must upgrade to the latest NPM after installation, since it gets updated
   and fixed more frequently than the Node version it's bundled with.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   brew install node
   npm install npm@latest -g
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   You should use https://www.npmjs.com if you ever want to search for packages,
   because the command-line search is terribly slow in NPM.

** Latest Git

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   brew install git
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** External tools required by Spacemacs packages

   Run all of these commands unless you're /sure/ what you're doing. All of
   these are required for normal operation of multiple Spacemacs layers.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   brew install multimarkdown # provides "markdown" binary
   brew install shellcheck # needed for linting in "shell-scripts"
   npm install -g tern # needed for javascript auto-completion
   npm install -g js-beautify # needed for javascript auto-formatting
   npm install -g jshint # needed for javascript error checking
   brew install fzf # needed for fzf (fuzzy find)
   brew install ag # needed for helm-ag (source greping)
   brew install editorconfig # core library needed for support
   brew install global --with-pygments --with-ctags --with-sqlite3 # source tagging
   brew install cscope # needed by some layers for source code searching
   #+END_EXAMPLE


* Spacemaxed

** Delete or move any existing "~/.spacemacs" file or "~/.spacemacs.d" folder

** Place my "spacemaxed" dotfolder on the hard disk as "~/.spacemacs.d/"

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone https://github.com/SteveJobzniak/spacemaxed.git ~/spacemaxed
   mv ~/spacemaxed/spacemaxed ~/.spacemacs.d
   rm -rf ~/spacemaxed # delete temporary folder
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Install YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu (railwaycat)'s Enhanced Emacs for macOS

   This will install the latest Emacs for macOS with all required addons, a nice
   Spacemacs icon and a link in /Applications. This version is far better than
   "vanilla" Emacs. It's built on the latest GNU Emacs sources, but adds tons of
   Mac-specific enhancements, bugfixes, performance and stability improvements.
   And it has built-in SVG support via WebKit.

   The command below takes a very long time to install. Wait for it.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
   brew install emacs-mac --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick --with-modules --with-xml2 --with-spacemacs-icon
   brew linkapps emacs-mac
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Install the development version of Spacemacs

   The development version is very stable, and is always way ahead of the master
   branch in terms of bugfixes.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # Install Spacemacs
   rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
   git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d

   # Switch to development version
   cd ~/.emacs.d && git checkout develop
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Launch Emacs (the GUI version) and let it install all packages

** Restart Emacs to finalize the package installation


* Updating Spacemacs in the future

** First press "[Update Packages]" on the Spacemacs starting page

** Then close Spacemacs and update the repository

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cd ~/.emacs.d && git pull --rebase
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Start Spacemacs again to complete the upgrade

** Lastly, check for and merge any changes to the user-config template

   First try pressing =SPC f e D= to diff your config against the built-in
   template. If that fails, just use a manual diff and apply any important
   changes:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   diff -u ~/.emacs.d/core/templates/.spacemacs.template ~/.spacemacs.d/init.el
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   There's also a very easy way to check what has changed between template
   versions. Just look for the =git= line that says something like
   =e2a45e0c..36c15b79 develop -> origin/develop=. It shows which revisions
   you have just moved between. Then just diff the template between them:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git diff e2a45e0c..36c15b79 core/templates/.spacemacs.template 
   #+END_EXAMPLE


* Uninstalling Spacemacs

  Just do all of the steps in reverse. As follows.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  brew unlinkapps emacs-mac
  brew rm emacs-mac
  brew untap railwaycat/emacsmacport
  rm -rf ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_EXAMPLE
